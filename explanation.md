# 1. Choice of base image to build container

For this assessment, the base image used to build the containers is `node:20-alpine3.21` because it is a lightweight and a minimal version of the official Node.js image therefore assisted to reduce the size of the image:
 
 1. Client:`node:20-alpine3.21`
 2. Backend: `node:20-alpine3.21`
 3. Mongo : `mongo:8.0`

## 2. Dockerfiles created for each container




## 3. Git Workflow to achieve the given tasks

To carry out the tasks given on the assessment, the below git workflow was used:

1. Fork the repository from the original repository shared.
2. Cloned the repo to my machine: `git clone https://github.com/slysiele/yolo.git`
3. Create a .gitignore file or use present one to add unnecessary files from version control
4.
