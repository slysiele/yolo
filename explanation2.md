# Vagrant & Ansible Automation

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to provision and configure an e-commerce web application using **Vagrant**, **Ansible**, and **Docker**. The application consists of a **frontend**, **backend**, and **MongoDB** service, each containerized and orchestrated through Ansible roles.

All tasks are automated using a structured Ansible playbook and Vagrant setup, providing a consistent and reproducible environment for deployment.
